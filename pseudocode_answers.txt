Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode help programmers develop algorithms by taking complex problems and breaking it down step by step using plain english like statements. This can then be converted into the correct sytax of the programming language such as Javascript.


If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing, pseudocode is for people too brainstorm a solution to a problem, not a computer.

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
COMPARE first number with second number
PRINT the number with greatest value

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

WHILE the number is greater than or equal to 1, AND the number is less than or equal to 100
PRINT the number

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT the specific data criteria
FOR every entry in the phonebook
	IF the entry in the phonebook EQUALS the specific data criteria
		RETURN specific entry found in phonebook
	ELSE
		RETURN entry not found

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function searchPhonebook(input, criteria) {

	for ( i >= 0; i = input.length, i++ ) {
		return (criteria === input[i]) ? criteria + "found" : criteria + "not found";
	}

}
